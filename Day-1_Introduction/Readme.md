<h1>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</h1>
    <br>
    <h1>What is DSA?</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Data Structures:</strong> These are specialized formats for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data. Efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. They provide a means to manage large amounts of data for various operations such as searching, sorting, and modifying data.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Examples of Data Structures:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Array:</strong> A collection of elements identified by index or key.</li>
            <li><strong>Linked List:</strong> A sequence of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.</li>
            <li><strong>Stack:</strong> A collection of elements that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.</li>
            <li><strong>Queue:</strong> A collection of elements that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.</li>
            <li><strong>Tree:</strong> A hierarchical structure with a root node and children nodes, where each node represents a data element.</li>
            <li><strong>Graph:</strong> A set of nodes connected by edges, used to represent relationships between elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Hash Table:</strong> A data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Algorithms:</strong> These are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems or performing tasks. Algorithms manipulate data within the data structures to perform tasks such as searching, sorting, and modifying data.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Examples of Algorithms:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sorting Algorithms:</strong> Arrange elements in a specific order (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort).</li>
            <li><strong>Searching Algorithms:</strong> Find the position of an element within a data structure (e.g., linear search, binary search).</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Solves problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant calculations (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem).</li>
            <li><strong>Greedy Algorithms:</strong> Make the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum (e.g., Prim’s algorithm, Kruskal’s algorithm).</li>
            <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Divides a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and combines their solutions (e.g., merge sort, quicksort).</li>
            <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Solves problems by trying partial solutions and then abandoning them if they do not lead to a valid solution (e.g., N-queens problem, Sudoku solver).</li>
            <li><strong>Graph Algorithms:</strong> Used to solve problems related to graph data structures (e.g., Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path, depth-first search, breadth-first search).</li>
        </ul>
